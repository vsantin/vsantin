### Hi there 👋

My name is Vinicius and I'm a full-stack developer. I`ve been worked with software development since 2010 and during this time I had the opportunity to work with many different technologies developing applications and coordinating development teams.

Currently, those are the technologies I am working on more often.

#### Server-side and API Developments
* ASP.NET (.NET and Core)
* Node.js

#### Front-side and JS Frameworks
* Vue.js (Nuxt.js 👌🏻)
* React.js

#### Databases
* SQL Server 👴🏻
* Firestore
* CosmosDB

Like all of us, I am in love with serverless platforms, I currently working a lot with Firebase and Azure Functions, Service Apps, and CosmosDB. Who is not?! 🤷‍♂️
